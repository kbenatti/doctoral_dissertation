In this repository, we present algorithm implementations for clustering with capacity constraints problem, including the fuzzy and non-fuzzy approaches.

In the clustering with capacity constraints problem, each point has an associated weight, and the sum weights of the points that make up each group is established a priori. We approach this problem from a non-fuzzy and fuzzy perspective. We present numerical tests that show the competitiveness of our methods compared to the classics in comparable cases.
